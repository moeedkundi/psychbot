    description: "Expert-level questions, significant credit for any correct insights"

scoring_process:
  step_1_content_analysis:
    - Parse the answer for key technical points
    - Identify correct vs incorrect statements
    - Note depth of explanation and examples
    - Assess logical flow and structure
  
  step_2_dimension_scoring:
    - Score each dimension independently (1-5 scale)
    - Apply role-level adjustments
    - Apply question difficulty modifiers
    - Document rationale for each score
  
  step_3_weighted_calculation:
    - Calculate weighted average based on dimension weights
    - Apply any additional context-specific adjustments
    - Ensure score reflects overall interview performance
    - Round to appropriate precision (0.1)
  
  step_4_validation:
    - Check score against qualitative assessment
    - Ensure consistency with previous questions
    - Validate against role and level expectations
    - Confirm alignment with feedback provided
